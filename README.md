With smart contracts and real-time checks,  
RentChain gives you zero stress!**

## What Is RentChain?

**RentChain is a decentralized platform for renting drones, cars, homes, or pro equipment — safely and autonomously — powered by blockchain.**

---

## Key Features

- **List items** with photos, GPS & deposit rules  
- **Smart contract** handles usage time & payment tools  
- **Mobile app** for renters on the go  
- **Web dashboard** for owners in full control  
- **Automatic return check** via sensors or pic  
- **Pay with tokens, or fiat, just click!**  
- **QR code to unlock the gear —  
  Rental’s yours, the coast is clear!**

---

## Intelligent Rental Flow

1. **Owner adds item** with price + deposit lock  
2. **Renter requests** via app (around the clock)  
3. **Smart contract spins** with rules & time  
4. **Deposit blocked** — renter signs the dotted line  
5. **QR code unlocks** the gate, lock, or drone  
6. **Return is checked** by Chainlink or phone  
7. **Deposit returns**, or some gets trimmed  
8. **Immutable log** — your rep is primed!
